        <P>Lorem Ipsum is essentially placeholder text that is often used by designers to test how their product will look once text has been inputted. Ipsum in its current form has been around since the 1960's and today is a cornerstone of dummy text for designers. Of course in the age of the web text is often formatted in an array of ways by HTML tags.</P>
